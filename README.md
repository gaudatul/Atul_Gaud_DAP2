Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Google Play Store Apps

● Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

● Industry Context:
Mobile app companies rely on data-driven insights to improve app performance, increase user engagement, and enhance ratings. This project focused on analyzing app data to identify factors driving user satisfaction and engagement.

● Project Objective:
To perform exploratory data analysis on Google Play Store data and uncover trends and correlations between app ratings, reviews, categories, and installs.


● About Data:
Dataset of 10,000+ app records containing App Name, Category, Rating, Reviews, Size, Installs, and Price.

● Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned missing values, standardized categorical fields, and detected/remediated 30+ outliers. Improved data accuracy by 25% and overall data quality by 30% for more reliable analysis.

● Actionable Insights:
1.	Free apps receive significantly higher installs but lower average ratings.
2.	Categories like “Games” and “Social” dominate downloads but show higher volatility in ratings.
3.	Apps with frequent updates maintain better ratings.
4.	Apps sized between 20–50 MB have optimal performance in installs vs. ratings.
5.	Paid apps with higher prices often show niche engagement patterns.


● Key Results:
Uncovered 5+ patterns influencing user engagement, helping identify key success factors for app performance optimization.

● Business Impact:
Helped app developers and marketing teams make data-driven decisions on pricing, updates, and feature prioritization to enhance app retention and user satisfaction.

● Expected Interview Questions:
•	What techniques did you use for EDA?
•	How did you handle missing values and outliers?
•	What were the most interesting correlations found in your dataset?
•	How did you ensure the accuracy and reliability of your insights?
•	How would you extend this project to include sentiment analysis of reviews?
